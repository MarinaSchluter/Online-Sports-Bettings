### ![alt text](Images/streamlit-1.png)**Streamlit App**

A Streamlit application has been created to show some of the results obtained during this project. It can be accessed directly from [Online Sports Betting](https://online-sports-bettings-kbrepywzhd5mjvfpihsmsb.streamlit.app/).    
  
This is a multi-tab application where you can browse through different information on each tab.     
  - Tabs & Content:     

    - Context: This tab provides an overview of the number of Online Sportbetting houses in Spain and their ratings. It has a filter to display them according to the rating of the public.       
    - Events Distribution: This tab shows the number of events (competitions) on which bets have been placed during the period recorded in the dataset used in the project.     
    - Wager vs Win: Overview and comparison of the amount bet by the players and the amount earned by the company. By using filters, some more concrete data can be displayed.      
    - PowerBI: A PowerBI panel with different statistics has been added in this Tab. It can also be consulted [PowerBI](https://app.fabric.microsoft.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiZTIyMjcxNjktZGExMS00MDljLWJmMjYtYzFiZDMzMmZhMDZiIiwidCI6IjhhZWJkZGI2LTM0MTgtNDNhMS1hMjU1LWI5NjQxODZlY2M2NCIsImMiOjl9&pageName=ReportSection).     
    - Prediction: In this tab you can predict the company's profit by specifying a sport group and the time of purchase of the bet.

### **üóÉÔ∏èMain Challenges**

  - Webscrapping: 
    - To access any Spanish site related to gambling, it is necessary to confirm that you are over 18 years of age.
    - It was necessary to automate the web browser using a webdriver to locate the age botton and provide waiting time to click as "yes" in order to acces the information. 
    - **Selenium** was used to this purpose. 
  - Outliers
  - Normalisation  
  - Correlation
  - Regression Model
